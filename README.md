# INF 554 Assignment 3

The aim of the assignment was to disect popular news media infographics using a visualization wheel. In the book by Cairo (Introduction to functional art of Information graphics and visualization) a visualization wheel is used to represnt the various features of an infogrpahics.

For this assignment, the topic that was chosen was "World Malaria Statics". In many developing countries Malaria is a significant problem, invoking country wide government and international intervention. Even historically Malaria has been a constant source of ailment for entire nations including the U.S which lost over sixt thousand soilders in world war II due to Malaria.

News media tries to spread awareness about Malaria by showcasing various stastics related to it. 

For this, two of the most popular platforms for infographics on these kinds of topics were chosen. World health organization (WHO) and CDC(center for disease prevention).

A simple html page was created where the two images were displayed. Then using inkscape the basic visulaization wheel was drawn and imported as an SVG in the html page. 

Based on the factor descriptions in the book the various points on the wheel were plotted and higlighted.  

After each wheel, three pieces of information were provided 1) What was done right or well : A simple acknowledgement of the things that were appropriate. 2). What was not done that well: Even though these infographics were made by extreme professionals and crtiquing them was not the aim but the aim was to showcase what else as a designer of these infogrpahics could have been personally done. 3) Imporvemnets: slight improvements and changes or suggestions.

The goal was to showcase knowledge of design metrics and familiarity with infogrpahics.
